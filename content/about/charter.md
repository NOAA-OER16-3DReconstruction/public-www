# Project Title: 3D Reconstruction from ROV Camera Arrays of Opportunity

__Project Start Date:__   1 November 2016

__Project End Date:__  31 October 2017

## Project Description

Produce 3D reconstructions from archival OER video from the _Deep Discoverer (D2)_ ROV and _Seirios_ vehicles.    Show the utility of 3D reconstruction for public outreach and for achieving science goals.   

## Project Boundaries

* Focus on archival data.   __Stretch / phase 2 goal:__ close integration with D2 operations and influencing D2 ops and data retention.
* Start with post-processing stretch to realtime.

## Product Goals or Objectives

Produce 3D reconstructions of "low hanging fruit" ROV video -- mission segments which are likely to be successfully processed and where reconstruction adds science value or interest.

Tools to pre-filter / pre-process video to prepare ROV videos for ingest (in post-proc or realtime).   Masking out fauna and marine debris.   Masking out ROV in Seirios video.  Lighting effects

## Benefits to Us

Demonstrates competency in 3D reconstruction esp for ROV ops.   Develops and refines software tools.  Open dialog with NOAA OER.

## Benefits to Customer

Public interest and science benefits of 3D reconstruction.  

Potential value in other image processing or image analysis domains.

## Metrics

Extent, quality and utility of 3D reconstructions.

Publications (science and methods).

## Deliverables

All software published in Open Source (Github) w/ appropriate license TBD.

Intermediate and final reporting to sponsor.

Public reporting of work via [blog](https://noaa-oer16-3dreconstruction.github.io/public-www/).

## Stakeholders

* NOAA
* [NOAA Office of Exploration and Research](http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/)

## Obstacles or Barriers

Quality and quantity of data available from NOAA archives

Reconstruction remains challenging, need to quickly assess potential of videos and focus on regions of most likely early success or high reward.

# Communications Plan

All interim reports as specified by sponsor.

Public "diary" or project maintained in blog.

Regular updates with NOAA (?)
